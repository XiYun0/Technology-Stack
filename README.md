## :ship:BigData Component

### Hadoop

>The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

## :light_rail:Machine learning

### Deep Learning

Deepmind's DQN successfully combines deep learning and reinforcement learning, so my research direction also needs to use this method.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is my research direction at the master's level.
Simply put, Reinforcement Learning describes the process of interaction between the agent and the environment, and its goal is to allow the agent to find an optimal strategy to maximize the cumulative reward.

### Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
